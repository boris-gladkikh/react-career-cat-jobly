This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Career Cat

Career Cat is a full stack job search application, which allows the user to create an account (with bcrypt security and password hashing), browse job listings by company or job, and single-click “apply” for a job. User can then see a list of applied jobs and edit their profile info on their profile page.



## How To:

- log in/register your user.
- change/update profile via "profile" tab.
- browse available jobs via "companies" tab, then click on companies to see what jobs they provide OR
- browse all available jobs regardless of company
- search bar capabilities to search by company name or position on both 'companies' and 'jobs' pages
- single click "apply" button to apply to job
- applied jobs can be seen on profile page


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
