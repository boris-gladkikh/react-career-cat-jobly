TODO 5/22/2020:
- figure out where to put function! - on job card right now - put it on job list?
- pass down function to jobList
- add delete button onto jobs applied in profile form.
- write unapply function - may have to write it in BACKEND SERVER
- profileForm= jobsAPplied should be useEffect, that triggers initially, then everytime unapply is clicked
- break up profile form into profile + form? 


ProfileForm
  -if no profile photo on file, use default photo

Footer
